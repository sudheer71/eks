ReplicaSets
ReplicaSets are a higher-level API that gives the ability to easily run multiple instances of a given pod ReplicaSets ensures that the exact number of pods(replicas) are always running in the cluster by replacing any failed pods with new ones
The replica count is controlled by the replicas field in the resource definition file

ReplicaSets uses set-based selectors to manage the pods
The major difference between a replication controller and replica set is that the rolling-update command works with Replication Controllers, but won't work with a Replica Set. This is because Replica Sets are meant to be used as the backend for Deployments (to be covered next)
• Deployments are recommended over ReplicaSets
